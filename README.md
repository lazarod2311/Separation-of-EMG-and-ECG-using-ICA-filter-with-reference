# Separation-of-EMG-and-ECG-using-ICA-filter-with-reference
This project was made in a group for the subject of interdisciplinary project of the biomedical engineering course.  
The objective was to separate an ECG signal that contaminated an EMG signal. For this, an ECG signal was used as a reference for the ICA algorithm, which performed the separation of the two signals. To assess the quality of the separation of the two signals (time series), autocorrelation was used.  

This work was done in a group.
